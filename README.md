<h1>How to run: </h1>
Clone the app and test on device of chose. I used Pixel 3A and Pixel 6 Pro for testing. Click play button inorder to install and run the app.

<h1>Usage: </h1>
Users can scroll through a list of pokemon and click on an item to navigate to a details pages. A user can also search for a valid Pokemon and see more details.

<h1>Project Overview:</h1>

Utilized MVVM architecture entirely in Jetpack Compose.

Implemented a shared ViewModel between the two screens.

Incorporated Hilt for Dependency Injection.

Used Paging library for pagination and infinite scrolling.

Used Navigation to help with app navigation of screens.

<h2>API Call Optimization:</h2>

Avoided chaining API calls to retrieve detailed Pokémon information to reduce network load.

API had limitations on how to get more details after detailed information was given. Multiple other api calls would be needed. So chose to implement 2 individual network request and use available information to increase user experience. API would need to be refactored to include neccessary data for list screen and details screen.

Implemented a placeholder image. Clicking on an item or searching for a Pokémon triggers a separate API call.


<h2>Application Flow:</h2>
PokemonListScreen: Initial screen displaying a list of Pokémon.

PokemonDetailScreen: Screen displaying detailed information about a selected Pokémon.
